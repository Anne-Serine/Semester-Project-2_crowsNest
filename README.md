## API Integration

The client application utilizes the Noroff API v2 to communicate with the backend server. It requires both a JWT token and an API Key for authentication and authorization. Users need to register an account and login to access their token. The application utilizes HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to communicate with the API endpoints.
